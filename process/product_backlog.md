## Product Backlog

| User Story | State | Business Value | Estimate Point | Conclusion Criteria | Sprint Review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| First working prototype. The main goal is to play against CPU. | DONE | 7 | 4 | A general user should be able to start Simone app with no crash, visualising the main menu with all the options (new game, settings, credits, highscore etc..) and he must play against the CPU. The game must be ended. | 28/06/2017 | 
| Scoring: the user can see the highscore | DONE | 4 | 5 | A general user should be able to see the local highscore. | 28/06/2017 | |
| Facebook integration: the user can see its facebook's friends and inviting them to play against himself | DONE | 8 | 5 | Currently the user can see the list of friends who have Simone app installed and play with them. | 28/06/2017 | |
| Multiplayer: a player must be able to play against another Facebook user | DONE | 9 | 7 | We are able to comunicate remotely through different devices. | 31/07/2017 | |
| Single Player must be completed considering: difficulty, stopping the game, score and minor things. | DONE | 8 | 4 | Already completed at third sprint | 31/07/2017 | |
| Scoring: the user can see the highscore. | DONE | 6 | 4 | Done, using Google Games. | 31/07/2017 | |
| Completing the game: all functions should be working fine, considering critical scenarios such as absence of connectivity, lack of resources, synchronizing data amongst devices. | NEW | 8 | 10 | Technically speaking, we have to move the local DB to a cloud solution. Firebase seems to be the right choice, instead of Pubnub. It's a critical refactoring. | --/--/2017 | |
